#- Locate execution path of the initial script.
	#- Done for squeezeM_merged.pl

#- Use proper execution paths in the configuration files. They can be dinamically built once we get the execution path of the initial script.

#- Unify the three initial scripts into a single one.

#- symlink raw fastq into the project folder instead of moving them.

- Adopt semantic versioning for in-house scripts (start from v1.0.0).

- Why raw reads are copied during mapbamsamples.pl??

- CheckM should be installed manually?

- when runing the pipeline, errors during bin_maxbin.pl were silent. If running the script by itself errors raised as expected.

- squeezeM.pl merged mode gives error after assembly.

- Luis' instructions are missing the part in which we create the database
	- And step 2 (run script) requires step 4 ("descomprimir fichero").
	- Step 5.2 entiendo que se refiere al directorio temp de la aplicaci√≥n.

- mysql -u user -p SqueezeM < game.sql
