#- Locate execution path of the initial script.
	#- Done for squeezeM_merged.pl

#- Use proper execution paths in the configuration files. They can be dinamically built once we get the execution path of the initial script.

#- Unify the three initial scripts into a single one.

#- symlink raw fastq into the project folder instead of moving them.

- Adopt semantic versioning for in-house scripts (start from v1.0.0).

- Why raw reads are copied during mapbamsamples.pl??

- CheckM should be installed manually?

- when runing the pipeline, errors during bin_maxbin.pl were silent. If running the script by itself errors raised as expected.

#- squeezeM.pl merged mode gives error after assembly.

#- Check which databases are downloaded via our script and which other are specific of some of the dependencies. Check the size of the independent ones and decide. 

#- we need blastcmd for making the databases

#- Test restart

#- Add spades

- Remove each nr tarball after decompressing it in make_nr_db.pl.
 
#- uncomment wget for nr database in make_nr_db.pl. (AND gzip/rm calls)

- nr.pal not removed by make_nr_db.pl? double check...
    - I manually removed it but double check...

#- Remove nr.faa after finishing making ALL the databases

#- Do we need the "scripts/preparing_databases/eggnog" folder?
	#I just removed it.

#- Remove non-sqlite files from db/LCA_tax directory.

- Is the parents.db sqlite database really needed? Bc lca.pl actually uses the txt version.

- Add links to the repos of all the software we use in the readme or wherever.

- Test db install in nonstandard location and assignment of proper path in the configuration file.

- make_databases.pl can't be killed with ctrl-C (it dies after a while...)

- More descriptive progress messages in make_databases.pl (not just "Running <script>.pl...")

- Modify and test restart.

-                my $ecode = system("perl $scriptdir/$scriptname $project");
                 if($ecode!=0)        { die "Stopping in STEP6 -> $scriptname\n"; }
                 TEST AND ADD TO ALL SYSTEM CALLS!


- Redirect verbosity of some outputs to /dev/null

- Add minpath support


#########
- Luis' instructions are missing the part in which we create the database
	- And step 2 (run script) requires step 4 ("descomprimir fichero").
	- Step 5.2 entiendo que se refiere al directorio temp de la aplicaci√≥n.

- mysql -u user -p SqueezeM < game.sql
